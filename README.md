The story was generated by ChatGPT (GPT-3.5), and all pictures generated by Midjourney (V5). I asked ChatGPT to randomly generate a short fairy tale. Then the entire story was adapted into a children's comic book. I used Midjourney to automatically design the appearance of the main character in the book. The story was broken down sentence by sentence, and each sentence was illustrated as a picture. Each sentence was fed as a prompt to Midjourney to generate a suitable illustration, and I also used ChatGPT or Bard to assist me to create more detailed prompts.

This is a test for the ultimate goal to fully automate the entire pipeline from writing a story to drawing the illustrations, even making a film. Current issues about comic book generation:

- a) The stability of the character’s appearance cannot be guaranteed. In each picture, the character’s appearance and clothes keep changing. Generative images can guarantee statistical similarities but cannot maintain the exact character image. (Even with the same seed, it cannot guarantee the stability of the character’s appearance. )
- b) The character’s emotions cannot be expressed well. Due to the samples of the character, who mostly has a smiling expression, the character in all subsequent illustrations mostly maintains a similar smile, even the pictures were generated by prompts that explicitly require fear or worry.
- c) Due to the randomness and different quality of generated images, it takes me about three hours to search for the most suitable pictures, and a significant amount of GPU time is required to complete the comic book – even it is only a 12-page book. Eventually we want the whole pipeline to be automated.
- d) Technically, the hands are usually a weak point, and Midjourney often struggles to draw them accurately.
- e) The images lack different layers, making it challenge for comic strips and animation production.


In order to achieve this goal, we need to do the following to further improve computer vision deep learning models:

- Ensure characters' appearance to be consistent in a series of pictures.
- Ensure accuracy in character illustration (e.g, no extra or missing fingers.)
- Ensure that the illustrations have multi-layer structure.
- The future program should be able to automatically select the most suitable illustrations.
