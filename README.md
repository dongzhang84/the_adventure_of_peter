The story was generated by ChatGPT (GPT-3.5), and all pictures generated by Midjourney (V5). I asked ChatGPT to randomly generate a short fairy tale. Then the entire story was adapted into a children's comic book. I used Midjourney to automatically design the appearance of the main character in the book. The story was broken down sentence by sentence, and each sentence was illustrated as a picture. Each sentence was fed as a prompt to Midjourney to generate a suitable illustration, and I also used ChatGPT or Bard to assist me to create more detailed prompts.

This is a test for the ultimate goal to fully automate the entire pipeline from writing a story to drawing the illustrations, even making a film. In order to achieve this goal, we need to do the following to further improve computer vision deep learning models:

- Ensure characters' appearance to be consistent in a series of pictures.
- Ensure accuracy in character illustration (e.g, no extra or missing fingers.)
- Ensure that the illustrations have multi-layer structure.
- The future program should be able to automatically select the most suitable illustrations.
